Convert the worker's description into a formal site report.

STRICT RULES — follow these without exception:
1. Capitalise proper nouns — site names, place names, project names must be properly capitalised (e.g. "Manchester" not "manchester").
2. The worker's description is the PRIMARY source of truth. Never add information not stated by the worker.
3. Never write quality statements like "Work completed to standard" or "Concrete finish satisfactory" unless the worker explicitly says so.
4. Never guess or assume missing information. Write "Not reported" if uncertain.
5. Distinguish clearly between materials USED/DELIVERED and materials REQUIRED/ORDERED.
6. Keep ISSUES RAISED for actual problems only — delays, defects, shortages, access issues, incidents.
7. Keep REQUESTS / ACTIONS REQUIRED separate — worker requests, material orders, planned procurement.
8. Never infer information from the image that the worker has not mentioned.

FORMAT — include every section below, in this exact order:

DATE: {today}

SITE: {site_name.strip().title() if site_name else "[Extract from input — properly capitalised. If not mentioned write Not specified]"}

PROJECT:
[Extract project name or description from input — properly capitalised. If not mentioned write "Not specified".]

WEATHER:
[Extract from worker's description only. If not mentioned write "Not recorded". Do not infer from image.]

WORKFORCE:
[Trades or number of workers mentioned by the worker. If not mentioned write "Not reported".]

ACTIVITIES COMPLETED:
- [List only work the worker confirms was completed. Do not assume completion unless stated.]

MATERIALS DELIVERED / USED:
- [Materials the worker confirms were delivered or used today. If none mentioned write "None reported".]

MATERIALS REQUIRED / ORDERED:
- [Materials the worker says are needed or ordered for upcoming work. If none mentioned write "None reported".]

PLANT & EQUIPMENT USED:
- [Machinery or equipment mentioned by the worker. If not mentioned write "Not reported". Do not add equipment seen only in image.]

QUALITY OBSERVATIONS:
- [Only record quality statements explicitly made by the worker. If none made write "None reported".]

SAFETY OBSERVATIONS:
- [PPE, hazards, incidents or near misses mentioned by the worker. If none mentioned write "None reported".]

ISSUES RAISED:
- [Actual problems only — delays, defects, shortages, access issues, incidents. If none write "None reported".]

REQUESTS / ACTIONS REQUIRED:
- [Worker requests, procurement needs, actions needed from others. If none write "None reported".]

NEXT DAY PLAN:
- [Planned work for tomorrow as stated by the worker. If not mentioned write "Not reported".]

FURTHER DETAILS:
[Anything not captured above that the worker mentioned. If nothing further write "None".]

SITE PHOTO OBSERVATIONS:
[Write 2-4 factual sentences based strictly on what is clearly visible in the image AND supported by the worker's description. 
Rules:
- Only describe what can be clearly seen — do not speculate.
- Do not infer weather from the image.
- Do not identify people.
- Do not describe architectural details (facades, finishes, balconies) unless directly relevant to the worker's report.
- Focus only on: construction progress relevant to the worker's account, materials or equipment visible that support the worker's description, site conditions, safety observations, visible issues.
- If the image supports the worker's account, say so specifically.
- If something is not clearly visible write "Not clearly visible" rather than guessing.
- The worker's description takes priority. The image is supplementary evidence only.]"""
